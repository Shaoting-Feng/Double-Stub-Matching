# Double-Stub-Matching

In accordance with user-specified conditions, theoretical calculations for the lengths of each branch line of the double stub can be performed to obtain matching conditions, which are then illustrated using Smith charts.

## About

This project provides a tool for performing theoretical calculations for the lengths of each branch line of a double stub. The matching conditions are then illustrated using Smith charts.

## Features

- Perform theoretical calculations for double stub matching.
- Visualize matching conditions using Smith charts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaoting-Feng/Double-Stub-Matching.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Double-Stub-Matching
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to perform calculations and generate Smith charts:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the `Instructions.txt` file for detailed usage.
