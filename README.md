# Double-Stub-Matching

In accordance with user-specified conditions, theoretical calculations for the lengths of each branch line of the double stub can be performed to obtain matching conditions, which are then illustrated using Smith charts.

## About

This project provides a tool for performing theoretical calculations for the lengths of each branch line of a double stub. The matching conditions are then illustrated using Smith charts.

## Features

- Perform theoretical calculations for double stub matching.
- Visualize matching conditions using Smith charts.

## Getting Started

1. Run the `MyAppInstaller_mcr.exe` file in the `for_redistribution` folder to install Matlab Runtime; if you already have Matlab installed, you might be able to skip this step.
2. Run the `.exe` file in the `for_redistribution_files_only` folder.
